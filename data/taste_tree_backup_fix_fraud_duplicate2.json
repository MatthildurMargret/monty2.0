Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins. Hardware reliability, unit economics (multi-robot per operator), and defensibility beyond suction/IP remain key diligence points. Sensitive to lack of frontier VC traction.\n\n[2025-07-29] We are actively tracking foundational infrastructure for robotics — from simulation platforms to real-time operating systems — as critical enablers of the next wave of physical AI. Startups like Foxglove and Xronos that abstract complexity in robot development and deployment align well with our belief in verticalized automation with software leverage..",

Risks: unclear productization beyond data services, high experimental cost to maintain freshness, and overlap with CRO revenue models.\n\n[2025-10-06] We are interested in AI-first drug discovery platforms that optimize for patient outcomes rather than target binding. Generative models that screen billions of compounds in silico can compress discovery timelines from years to weeks, particularly valuable in oncology, rare diseases, and immunology where datasets are small.

      "interest": "[2025-10-13] We are tracking vertically specialized fintech platforms serving professional associations. SMB-oriented financial suites for niche trades (pharmacists, veterinarians, welders) can achieve durable deposits and zero-loss lending economics. Filters: exclusive association partnerships, AR/AP automation within workflow, and ≥10K active small-business accounts. Risks: slow multi-association scaling, margin pressure from regional banks, and potential feature overlap with Ramp/Brex if they move down-market.\n\n[2025-09-29] We are tracking fintech infrastructure that embeds equipment or asset financing at the point of sale. Fragmented workflows create opportunities for agentic financing platforms that streamline underwriting and distribution. Filters: distribution secured via OEMs or vertical SaaS, defensibility beyond simple capital provision, and ability to scale efficiently in fragmented verticals. Risks: timing of adoption, capital intensity, and risk of adverse selection if distribution is not locked in early..\n\n[2025-07-29] We are excited about agentic infrastructure, but cautious around horizontal B2B SaaS without clear fintech or commerce applications.: While platforms like Roya (commercial agent orchestration) and RTXEN (agentic FinOps OS) show promise, our core value-add is stronger when there is a verticalized GTM, such as fintech or commerce. We prefer use cases where orchestration layers have clear commercial outputs or data feedback loops, not generic dashboards or BI tools.

While we find the team and technology strong, we have questions about their ability to scale enterprise sales and differentiate from competitors.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We discussed companies like Vadera Labs and others in AI-driven appraisals for niche markets (e.g., collectibles, industrial equipment). These markets are interesting to us, but we see challenges in validation, scalability, and market size that limit their appeal.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are excited about AI legal tech platforms focused on negotiation and deal optimization for operators, not just lawyers. We prefer tools that replace legal process fees with revenue-generating AI services (e.g., automated term sheet negotiation, contract optimization for GCs and CROs).\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are tracking RPA’s evolution into deterministic AI agents in regulated verticals. We believe flexible, AI-enhanced RPA has near-term adoption advantages in compliance-heavy sectors like healthcare. That said, we are skeptical of RPA startups positioning as horizontal automation tools unless they demonstrate deep vertical traction and defensible infra advantages. Long-term, we expect agents to cannibalize many RPA use cases.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We continue to de-prioritize consulting-style AI tools and marketplaces. We passed on Thoughtly due to limited AI differentiation and an SMB-focused wedge that lacks breakout potential. We are not looking for low-NRR tooling unless it shows viral bottoms-up adoption or extremely strong sales DNA.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are skeptical of standalone accent softening plays as venture-scale businesses. While useful in BPO and call center workflows, the long-term risk is feature-ization by larger AI voice stacks. Platforms that can generalize real-time voice personalization into broader human-AI interfaces may present a more compelling opportunity.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We remain skeptical of generic compliance tooling startups. Platforms that automate compliance-heavy workflows using AI agents could be interesting, but require deep vertical focus, robust infra defensibility, and clear monetization paths (risk/data layers). We are not investing in broad horizontal compliance SaaS.",

              "interest": "New subcategory created for pipeline companies. Generated on 2025-09-19\n\n[2025-10-13] We are tracking AI construction-design copilots for electrical and mechanical schematics. Platforms that generate compliant schematics in minutes can remove major bottlenecks for contractors and engineering firms bidding on projects. Filters: interoperability with Autodesk / Revit, measured cycle-time reduction (10× faster drafts), and early partnerships with mid-market GCs. Risks: change-management friction in legacy firms, competition from incumbent CAD vendors, and need for continuous code-library updates for safety compliance.\n\n[2025-10-06] We are interested in AI-enabled platforms for preconstruction workflows, particularly RFP triage and risk management. Automating high-cost, high-frequency bid processes creates direct P&L impact for GCs, with potential to expand into contextual project risk management layers. Filters: demonstrable cost savings per RFP, integration with existing workflows, and potential for strategic acquisition. Risks: construction tech adoption remains slow, consensus skepticism persists, and line-item budgets are not well defined..\n\n[2025-10-13] We are cautious on AI compliance and design tools for civil infrastructure projects. Platforms parsing 1,000+ page RFPs and cross-checking design documents promise efficiency in bridge and road projects. Filters: integration into engineering workflows (e.g., Word plugins), accuracy of compliance checks, and ability to reduce costly rework. Risks: timelines in public infrastructure are slow, pain point is less acute than in data centers/industrial projects, and preference may shift toward full-stack AI engineering providers.\n\n[2025-10-06] We are tracking AI applications in patent and IP management. Semantic approaches to prior art search and claims validation could reduce invalidation rates and augment existing legal workflows. Filters: defensibility in preparing and defending claims, ability to complement rather than replace law firms, and hybrid AI + human-in-the-loop models. Risks: consulting-heavy models risk commoditization, scalability is unproven, and pricing pressure may create a race to the bottom.\n\nNew subcategory created for pipeline companies.

[2025-10-13] Workflow AI in industrial engineering and manufacturing is reaching repeatable depth; “RPA for high-skill labor” is the next durable automation wave.\n\n[2025-10-13] We are tracking AI-driven deepfake and scam detection infrastructure. Startups targeting KYC/ID verification providers with image/video authenticity checks address urgent fraud pain points. Filters: proprietary data generation loops, ability to surpass the 95%+ accuracy threshold to replace human review, and defensibility against large security incumbents. Risks: dataset advantage may be fleeting, enterprises may bundle into broader CISO security stacks, and narrow KYC wedge may not scale into large enterprise budgets.\n\nNew subcategory created for deal announcements.

Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins. Hardware reliability, unit economics (multi-robot per operator), and defensibility beyond suction/IP remain key diligence points. Sensitive to lack of frontier VC traction.\n\n[2025-07-29] We are actively tracking foundational infrastructure for robotics \u2014 from simulation platforms to real-time operating systems \u2014 as critical enablers of the next wave of physical AI. Startups like Foxglove and Xronos that abstract complexity in robot development and deployment align well with our belief in verticalized automation with software leverage..",

        "interest": "[2025-08-07] We looked at companies like Solurian that are building AI-driven weather forecasting models targeting enterprise clients. While we find the team and technology strong, we have questions about their ability to scale enterprise sales and differentiate from competitors.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We discussed companies like Vadera Labs and others in AI-driven appraisals for niche markets (e.g., collectibles, industrial equipment). These markets are interesting to us, but we see challenges in validation, scalability, and market size that limit their appeal.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are excited about AI legal tech platforms focused on negotiation and deal optimization for operators, not just lawyers. We prefer tools that replace legal process fees with revenue-generating AI services (e.g., automated term sheet negotiation, contract optimization for GCs and CROs).\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are tracking RPA\u2019s evolution into deterministic AI agents in regulated verticals. We believe flexible, AI-enhanced RPA has near-term adoption advantages in compliance-heavy sectors like healthcare. That said, we are skeptical of RPA startups positioning as horizontal automation tools unless they demonstrate deep vertical traction and defensible infra advantages. Long-term, we expect agents to cannibalize many RPA use cases.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We continue to de-prioritize consulting-style AI tools and marketplaces. We passed on Thoughtly due to limited AI differentiation and an SMB-focused wedge that lacks breakout potential. We are not looking for low-NRR tooling unless it shows viral bottoms-up adoption or extremely strong sales DNA.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are skeptical of standalone accent softening plays as venture-scale businesses. While useful in BPO and call center workflows, the long-term risk is feature-ization by larger AI voice stacks. Platforms that can generalize real-time voice personalization into broader human-AI interfaces may present a more compelling opportunity.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We remain skeptical of generic compliance tooling startups. Platforms that automate compliance-heavy workflows using AI agents could be interesting, but require deep vertical focus, robust infra defensibility, and clear monetization paths (risk/data layers). We are not investing in broad horizontal compliance SaaS.",

Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins.

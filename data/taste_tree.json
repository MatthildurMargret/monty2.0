Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins. Hardware reliability, unit economics (multi-robot per operator), and defensibility beyond suction/IP remain key diligence points. Sensitive to lack of frontier VC traction.\n\n[2025-07-29] We are actively tracking foundational infrastructure for robotics — from simulation platforms to real-time operating systems — as critical enablers of the next wave of physical AI. Startups like Foxglove and Xronos that abstract complexity in robot development and deployment align well with our belief in verticalized automation with software leverage..",

We prefer use cases where orchestration layers have clear commercial outputs or data feedback loops, not generic dashboards or BI tools. We're also mindful of intense early competition and commoditization in agent infra.\n"

[2025-08-11] Export-focused fintech (e.g., Shield) is interesting if paired with AI and infrastructure plays. We are seeing underserved export markets emerge as fintech infrastructure opportunities, especially when compliance and onboarding are automated using AI. We're looking for fintech infra companies that can build end-to-end export platforms and monetize risk, data, or workflow layers. Margins, take rates, and use-case expansion (e.g., cards, treasury) matter.\n. [2025-08-11] We are interested in B2B cross-border payments platforms combining regulated banking infrastructure with stablecoin settlement rails. Integration into local real-time payment systems (e.g., Brazil’s PICS) plus multi-currency named accounts and FX liquidity APIs creates high switching costs for enterprise customers. Key filters: regulatory moat, stablecoin + fiat settlement in one platform, and enterprise adoption in emerging markets. We are sensitive to heavy early revenue concentration.\n",

Lark Payments (ex-Stripe engineers) and Lava Payments both address the gap in token-based and credit-expiring billing that Stripe cannot handle natively. Filters: AI-native usage models, developer-first adoption, stablecoin integration. Risks: crowded landscape (Paid, Metronome, wrappers on Stripe), early go-to-market strategies still developing, and need for clearer product vision to scale beyond initial developer traction.We are interested in next-generation billing and payments infrastructure for AI-native and usage-based business models. Paid.ai, backed by EQT and Sequoia, is the most credible team in the space (Manny Medina, ex-Outreach). Lava and Lark validate strong developer pain but lack the product depth and founder profile to win a winner-take-all market. Filters: AI-driven usage billing, stablecoin integration, agentic payment flows. Risks: crowded space (Paid, Metronome, Autumn, wrappers on Stripe), and weaker founders may get acquired acqui-hire style rather than scale.",

Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins. Hardware reliability, unit economics (multi-robot per operator), and defensibility beyond suction/IP remain key diligence points. Sensitive to lack of frontier VC traction.\n\n[2025-07-29] We are actively tracking foundational infrastructure for robotics — from simulation platforms to real-time operating systems — as critical enablers of the next wave of physical AI. Startups like Foxglove and Xronos that abstract complexity in robot development and deployment align well with our belief in verticalized automation with software leverage..",

Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n\n[2025-08-11] While we see potential in the home health or industrial robotics space, we are concerned about go-to-market challenges, vertical-specific sales processes, and the lack of commercially ready traction.

      "interest": "[2025-08-07] We looked at companies like Solurian that are building AI-driven weather forecasting models targeting enterprise clients. While we find the team and technology strong, we have questions about their ability to scale enterprise sales and differentiate from competitors.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We discussed companies like Vadera Labs and others in AI-driven appraisals for niche markets (e.g., collectibles, industrial equipment). These markets are interesting to us, but we see challenges in validation, scalability, and market size that limit their appeal.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are excited about AI legal tech platforms focused on negotiation and deal optimization for operators, not just lawyers. We prefer tools that replace legal process fees with revenue-generating AI services (e.g., automated term sheet negotiation, contract optimization for GCs and CROs).\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are tracking RPA’s evolution into deterministic AI agents in regulated verticals. We believe flexible, AI-enhanced RPA has near-term adoption advantages in compliance-heavy sectors like healthcare. That said, we are skeptical of RPA startups positioning as horizontal automation tools unless they demonstrate deep vertical traction and defensible infra advantages. Long-term, we expect agents to cannibalize many RPA use cases.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We continue to de-prioritize consulting-style AI tools and marketplaces. We passed on Thoughtly due to limited AI differentiation and an SMB-focused wedge that lacks breakout potential. We are not looking for low-NRR tooling unless it shows viral bottoms-up adoption or extremely strong sales DNA.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We are skeptical of standalone accent softening plays as venture-scale businesses. While useful in BPO and call center workflows, the long-term risk is feature-ization by larger AI voice stacks. Platforms that can generalize real-time voice personalization into broader human-AI interfaces may present a more compelling opportunity.\n.\n\n[2025-08-07] We remain skeptical of generic compliance tooling startups. Platforms that automate compliance-heavy workflows using AI agents could be interesting, but require deep vertical focus, robust infra defensibility, and clear monetization paths (risk/data layers). We are not investing in broad horizontal compliance SaaS.",

Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.\n.\n\n[2025-08-05] We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins.

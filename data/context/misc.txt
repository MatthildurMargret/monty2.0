NOT interested in pure biotech companies (e.g. biopharma, biotech, etc.) - prefer more Techbio 
If it's healthcare related, we are interested in techbio and more tech forward companies, not biotech and not pharma and not medical devices and hardware. 
Really excited about robotics, especially in industrial settings where safety is critical
NOT investing in consulting services or agencies or venture studios. Only companies that are venture backable. 
We are interested in healthcare data monetization, but we are concerned about regulatory challenges, long sales cycles, and lack of differentiation in existing solutions like Truveta. We prefer AI-focused solutions rather than pure bioinformatics or diagnostics due to monetization and scalability challenges.
While we see potential in the home health or industrial robotics space, we are concerned about go-to-market challenges, vertical-specific sales processes, and the lack of commercially ready traction. Armstrong's dishwasher robot highlighted for us the difficulty of scaling robotics technology due to training complexity, despite its long-term potential.
We find TallyMarks offers a compelling solution for enterprise data modernization, but we lack the technical expertise and network in DevOps and SaaS infrastructure to be a strong partner. The competitive and technical nature of the space further complicates its fit for our investment thesis.
We see that Planetary Processing addresses scalability in multiplayer gaming, which is a clear pain point in the industry. However, we have concerns about the founder's transition to a CTO role, financing risks, and competition from larger players. The technical solution is promising, and we plan to conduct further diligence.
We looked at companies like Solurian that are building AI-driven weather forecasting models targeting enterprise clients. While we find the team and technology strong, we have questions about their ability to scale enterprise sales and differentiate from competitors.
We discussed companies like Vadera Labs and others in AI-driven appraisals for niche markets (e.g., collectibles, industrial equipment). These markets are interesting to us, but we see challenges in validation, scalability, and market size that limit their appeal.
We reviewed Falcon, which offers an embedded platform for banks to combat scams and fraud. However, we find its technical complexity and differentiation from existing solutions like Careful to be unclear. While there is early traction, it feels to us like a point solution with uncertain scalability.
We noted that Vermont is gaining traction in mid-market e-commerce and is expanding into enterprise, SMB, and agency channels. We have concerns about tariff-related softness in the core mid-market, but we see promise in newer growth channels.
We discussed the home health space, with opportunities around aging-in-place solutions and financial products for elder care. However, we see the sector's challenges, including tough go-to-market dynamics and fragmented caregiver markets, as significant barriers to investment.
We discussed companies like Velocity Payments and others in fintech fraud prevention. We remain interested in the fintech space but are cautious about overlapping solutions and scalability challenges.
We are excited about AI-driven drug discovery platforms that combine proprietary multimodal datasets with generative biology and experimental feedback loops. We prefer companies building multi-shot therapeutic engines rather than single-asset biotech plays.
We are NOT interested in pure biotech companies focused on single therapies or per-patient personalized therapeutics unless there is a clearly differentiated techbio platform component. We are cautious about the scalability and regulatory complexity of personalized cancer vaccines and per-patient biologics manufacturing.
We are interested in biologics manufacturing optimization and biomanufacturing infrastructure, especially where AI improves biologic production efficiency (e.g., CHO cells, CAR-T manufacturing, active control cells). However, we are mindful of geopolitical risks in biomanufacturing supply chains and the competitive landscape in Asia.
We remain interested in healthcare data workflow tools but are cautious about companies pitching AI solutions that are too broad or generic (e.g., "AI for doctors" chatbots). We prefer narrow, specialty-specific approaches with clear go-to-market plans and measurable outcomes, such as urology or cardiology-focused systems.
We are tracking companies building AI tools for tumor boards and oncology decision-making but are concerned about unclear data monetization strategies and the risk of being commoditized by broader AI offerings from incumbents.
We are excited about AI legal tech platforms focused on negotiation and deal optimization for operators, not just lawyers. We prefer tools that replace legal process fees with revenue-generating AI services (e.g., automated term sheet negotiation, contract optimization for GCs and CROs).
We are interested in payment infrastructure for the next generation of AI-native and no-code businesses, especially tools that simplify Stripe integration, real-time reconciliation, usage-based billing, and global compliance. We need to validate that these solutions are defensible and not easily replicated by incumbents.
We are cautious about fintech fraud orchestration dashboards that aggregate existing point solutions without solving for core fraud detection (e.g., synthetic fraud). We prefer AI-driven risk mitigation systems that directly address fraud vectors.
We are interested in infrastructure for stablecoin-based treasury management and corporate payments, particularly for European and global use cases. We are mindful of US regulatory hurdles for yield-generating stablecoin products.
We see potential in niche insurance categories like high-end auto, motorcycle, and underutilized assets where traditional carriers misprice risk. We are cautious about consumer auto insurance startups targeting "high-risk drivers" due to underwriting profitability concerns.
We are cautious about gaming infrastructure companies targeting multiplayer scalability or AI-powered NPC generation. The sales cycles are long, success is often tied to viral hits, and the SaaS playbook does not translate well to gaming studios.
We are tracking AI labor solutions for logistics and trucking recruitment but do not find current approaches compelling. We prefer logistics infrastructure plays with broader applicability beyond driver churn reduction.
We are interested in AI-driven materials discovery and self-driving lab concepts but recognize the high operational complexity in combining AI design loops with physical lab execution. We plan to track this space long term.
We are excited about agentic infrastructure, but cautious around horizontal B2B SaaS without clear fintech or commerce applications.: While platforms like Roya (commercial agent orchestration) and RTXEN (agentic FinOps OS) show promise, our core value-add is stronger when there is a verticalized GTM, such as fintech or commerce. We prefer use cases where orchestration layers have clear commercial outputs or data feedback loops, not generic dashboards or BI tools. We're also mindful of intense early competition and commoditization in agent infra.
Agentic FinOps is a category we want to track closely. We believe there will be winners in building intelligent OS layers for CFOs and financial operations. However, we are looking for founders with high focus, strong velocity, and clear wedge entry into specific financial workflows. Broad, unfocused product surfaces are red flags. We are open to going early in this space with the right team.
We're excited about robotics and sensor-native foundation models as a wedge into the physical world. Archetype, building a foundation model for the physical world via multimodal sensor data, stood out for its enterprise traction and generalizable safety/compliance applications. We are particularly interested in platforms that abstract physical sensor data into programmable intelligence, as a path to robotics software scale. However, we are sensitive to round dynamics and will push for structured entry (e.g., discount to A or interim rounds).
Stablecoin infrastructure is a core emerging theme. We believe the market is bifurcating into (1) orchestration platforms for global, programmable money movement (e.g., DO, Wallapay) and (2) enterprise-grade stablecoin treasury management for corporates (e.g., Crypto, Velocity). We are open to placing multiple bets in both categories. We look for strong global licensing footprints, enterprise traction, and Stripe-level developer experiences. Founders with Revolut/Worldpay-style DNA are a plus. Regulatory defensibility and speed of GTM execution will determine winners.
Export-focused fintech (e.g., Shield) is interesting if paired with AI and infrastructure plays. We are seeing underserved export markets emerge as fintech infrastructure opportunities, especially when compliance and onboarding are automated using AI. We're looking for fintech infra companies that can build end-to-end export platforms and monetize risk, data, or workflow layers. Margins, take rates, and use-case expansion (e.g., cards, treasury) matter.
We are tracking RPA’s evolution into deterministic AI agents in regulated verticals. We believe flexible, AI-enhanced RPA has near-term adoption advantages in compliance-heavy sectors like healthcare. That said, we are skeptical of RPA startups positioning as horizontal automation tools unless they demonstrate deep vertical traction and defensible infra advantages. Long-term, we expect agents to cannibalize many RPA use cases.
We continue to prioritize frontier robotics with real unit economic leverage and software advantage. Veer Robotics (facade-cleaning robots) fits squarely in our robotics thesis: replacing high-risk manual labor with vertically-integrated automation that also captures unique inspection data. We're sensitive to capital efficiency, leasing models, and software data upsell opportunities. Preference for teams transitioning from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous over time.
We are interested in legal tech, but skeptical of generic tooling plays. We prefer verticalized legal platforms focused on specific high-volume categories (e.g., small claims, insurance defense) where AI replaces human workflow. Selling to GCs or law firms directly remains difficult unless there's a deeply embedded GTM edge or AI-native operational model. We are more excited about full-stack AI law firms than horizontal legal SaaS.
We are not investing in biotech plays without a techbio wedge. We passed on companies like Neosplice due to lack of commercial clarity, academic founder posture, and regulatory/scientific risk. Even in cases where there is scientific promise, we look for compelling software leverage, differentiated datasets, and go-to-market plans that avoid single-asset development traps.
We continue to de-prioritize consulting-style AI tools and marketplaces. We passed on Thoughtly due to limited AI differentiation and an SMB-focused wedge that lacks breakout potential. We are not looking for low-NRR tooling unless it shows viral bottoms-up adoption or extremely strong sales DNA.
We are bullish on AI-native simulation platforms that replace static, historical Monte Carlo models in financial stress testing and hedging workflows. The opportunity lies in building proprietary GAN-based engines for time series forecasting in opaque, data-sparse markets (e.g., fixed income). Founder credibility and quant-side adoption velocity are critical filters.
We are interested in techbio platforms that treat mRNA as an engineering substrate, not a modality. Closed-loop design systems that optimize for expression durability and tissue targeting unlock large therapeutic white spaces. Key filters: proprietary data generation, software leverage, and co-founder teams blending deep science with ML engineering.
We believe a new category will emerge at the intersection of wearables, calendaring, and agentic task automation, turning passive health data into actionable workflows. Consumer GTM remains challenging; we look for teams with deep product DNA and data orchestration strategies that can avoid becoming a point solution.
We continue to track vertical robotics that replace dangerous and repetitive manual labor, especially where recurring leasing models and inspection data upsells can drive software margins. Hardware reliability, unit economics (multi-robot per operator), and defensibility beyond suction/IP remain key diligence points. Sensitive to lack of frontier VC traction.
We are skeptical of standalone accent softening plays as venture-scale businesses. While useful in BPO and call center workflows, the long-term risk is feature-ization by larger AI voice stacks. Platforms that can generalize real-time voice personalization into broader human-AI interfaces may present a more compelling opportunity.
We are interested in platforms that can high-throughput map antibody-protein interactions for autoimmunity, but remain cautious of biotech plays that lack clear software leverage. Informatics layers that accelerate discovery pipelines without requiring new biology are attractive, but GTM clarity and tech differentiation are non-negotiable filters.
We are passing on consultancy-like AI platforms that target clinical trial design simulations unless there’s a clear wedge into automating regulatory workflows or replacing legacy software systems. The market opportunity lies in replacing human-run simulation studies, not in incremental design tools
We remain skeptical of generic compliance tooling startups. Platforms that automate compliance-heavy workflows using AI agents could be interesting, but require deep vertical focus, robust infra defensibility, and clear monetization paths (risk/data layers). We are not investing in broad horizontal compliance SaaS.
We are interested in B2B cross-border payments platforms combining regulated banking infrastructure with stablecoin settlement rails. Integration into local real-time payment systems (e.g., Brazil’s PICS) plus multi-currency named accounts and FX liquidity APIs creates high switching costs for enterprise customers. Key filters: regulatory moat, stablecoin + fiat settlement in one platform, and enterprise adoption in emerging markets. We are sensitive to heavy early revenue concentration.
We remain skeptical of generic “AI agent” orchestration platforms for regulated industries unless they deliver verifiable compliance and model explainability at scale. The opportunity is in proprietary LLM fine-tuning with expert-in-loop data annotation and synthetic data expansion to meet regulatory demands in banking and healthcare. Key diligence: depth of regulatory integrations, scalability of model oversight, and sales motion into Tier-1 regulated enterprises.
We continue to track vertical robotics software layers for warehouse and manufacturing automation that replace engineer-dependent, rigid workflows with VLM/VLA-powered systems optimized for edge deployments. Modular integration with existing hardware can be a wedge. Filters: measurable throughput gains in dynamic workflows, industrial-grade reliability, and defensibility beyond commoditized hardware. We are sensitive to long sales cycles and risk of displacement by multi-purpose humanoids.
We are interested in biologics manufacturing enablement platforms that apply AI to cell manipulation and process optimization, targeting bottlenecks in scaling therapeutic production. The market is large, driven by the dominance of biologics in top-selling drugs. Key filters: defensible manufacturing IP, penetration into pharma/CMO supply chains, and ability to win in high-capex, scale-driven markets. We remain cautious on customer concentration in Asia without clear U.S. market access.
We are interested in AI-driven lab platforms that close the loop between image-based phenotyping, multi-omics readouts, and hypothesis generation to accelerate oncology drug discovery. The opportunity lies in combining high-throughput experimental feedback with predictive models to identify novel mechanisms in a fraction of traditional timelines. Filters: strength of founding team across ML and wet lab execution, ability to generate proprietary datasets, and clear differentiation from existing image-omics players.
We are skeptical of wallet-based marketing channels unless distribution and engagement economics are proven at scale. While push-enabled offers in native Apple/Google/Samsung wallets can create a new owned channel for enterprises, sub-$1M ARR and heavy reliance on partnerships (e.g., Blackhawk Network) limit defensibility. Filters: ability to own enterprise relationships, sustained opt-in engagement, and category leadership before platform owners close the channel.
We remain cautious on sales tax automation platforms at later-stage valuations. While regulatory tailwinds create urgency, the market is likely to consolidate into one or two winners. We will not pursue late-stage entries unless we have a differentiated wedge or asymmetric entry point.
Foodtech is a tough category, especially when it involves commodity (fat/oil) and fermentation process (high cost to scale manufacturing, and it's a playbook I'm not too familiar with).
NOT interested in religious companies or companies that focus on particular religions or spiritual practices
We are interested in stablecoin-based cross-border payment platforms, particularly those embedding compliance orchestration and enterprise payout rails rather than just consumer wallets. The opportunity lies in meeting migrant workers at the point of income and keeping flows digital (USD wallets, bill pay, card rails) to reduce cash-out leakage. Filters: proven compliance architecture, enterprise distribution, and retention of funds in-system. We remain cautious on crowdedness of the space and the risk that trust-rich incumbents capture share.
We are tracking AI agents for retail investing as Gen Z/Gen Alpha demand new forms of decision support. Always-on, portfolio-aware research copilots may represent the next brokerage interface. The opportunity is in cultural fit with creator-driven investing and community alpha. Key diligence: defensibility versus incumbents, sustained engagement, and ability to capture mindshare before large fintechs add similar features.
We remain interested in healthcare fraud prevention and payer data infrastructure, where $300B+ in leakage creates a structural wedge. The most promising angle is unifying fragmented payer data to improve Medicare Advantage star ratings and reimbursement. Filters: ability to integrate across disparate data sources, targeted entry points in high-value claims flows, and proof of ROI for plans. We remain cautious of horizontal platforms without a clear disease- or claims-specific wedge.
We are cautious on AI-driven penetration testing platforms. While enterprise demand for agentic pen testing is growing, the market is highly crowded, and broad platform claims lack defensibility. The opportunity may sit in coupling prevention with cyber insurance or success-based pricing models. Key diligence: depth of domain specialization in regulated industries, proof of superior detection, and monetization strategy.
We are interested in AI-native lab platforms targeting synthesis bottlenecks in drug discovery. Natural-language-to-experiment design connected to robotic execution could compress timelines by orders of magnitude. Timing is favorable as LLMs now reason over chemistry reliably. Filters: proprietary integration into lab workflows, quality of pharma partnerships, and pace of execution. Defensibility must extend beyond access to LLMs.
We continue to track AI-driven accounting and tax automation. Regulatory complexity, CPA shortages, and data fragmentation create a strong wedge. The opportunity is in nuanced workflows (depreciation schedules, K-1 handling) that require expert-level judgment, not just rule encoding. Filters: access to proprietary training data via top firms, founder depth in accounting/tax, and trust with enterprise customers. We remain cautious on solutions without clear differentiation from incumbents like Intuit.
We are interested in AI-enabled architecture and construction design tools. Automating feasibility analysis, parcel compliance, and construction drawings could shift margins from cost-plus professional services toward high-margin software. Proprietary parcel/curb-cut datasets and early trust with developers are differentiators. Filters: defensibility of data advantage, ability to expand into construction documentation, and fit with standard modular projects.
We remain cautious on local family-care and caregiver marketplaces. Despite clear need on both sides, marketplace liquidity is regional, margins are capped by human labor, and historical attempts (care.com, trusted) have struggled to scale. The opportunity may lie in caregiver empowerment (education, upskilling) rather than pure matching.
We are tracking air-freight marketplaces that integrate directly with airlines to optimize capacity and weight balancing. The structural need is real in high-value/perishable goods, but sales cycles are long and ARR growth has been slow. Filters: defensible airline integrations, ability to serve pharma/perishables, and differentiation from ocean freight optimizations. We remain cautious on market size and cyclicality.
We are not interested in diagnostic-heavy healthcare businesses that rely on daily patient engagement and physician push — adoption and integration hurdles remain too high.
We are not interested in caregiver/family-care marketplaces as a core investment category; structural scaling challenges outweigh market need.
We are cautious on Singapore-based biotech picks-and-shovel CRO platforms; better suited for growth equity/private equity than early-stage VC.
We are not pursuing local surveying / AI survey automation — fragmented, commoditized, and insufficient differentiation.
We are interested in verticalized AI platforms for payer procurement and vendor management; the problem is real (multi-year approval cycles, vendor fatigue), but defensibility against large incumbents like Microsoft is questionable. Filters: mid-sized plan adoption, regulatory trust, path beyond pilots.
We are tracking AI agents for accounting operations, starting with accrual/expense management in firms like Deloitte. Strong net revenue retention is encouraging; wedge lies in forward-deployed engineers and workflow automation.
We are monitoring Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a potential distribution layer in travel. Platforms enabling airlines/hotels to expose inventory for agent interfaces (ChatGPT, etc.) could be sticky, but depend heavily on vendor adoption and commoditization risk at the model layer.
We remain cautious on pure software layers for robotics; value capture may favor robot manufacturers. That said, robotics data platforms (Applied Intuition analogs, Roughneck) with proprietary datasets could be compelling wedges.
We are interested in middleware layers for generative video — tools that refine, extend, and enhance foundation model outputs (e.g., overcoming Sora’s 8-second limits).
We are tracking sustainable textile dye platforms using microbial engineering. The market is large (20% of global wastewater, high consumer pull) but dependent on biomanufacturing scalability and cost competitiveness.
We are interested in AI pathology platforms that go beyond diagnostics to stratify patients and accelerate clinical trials (e.g., bone marrow disease imaging). Filters: pharma partnerships, regulatory clarity, mechanistic depth.
We are interested in synthetic biology applied to drug inputs (e.g., microbe-produced heparin, oligosaccharides). This represents an overlooked drug modality with geopolitical and safety tailwinds; key diligence is cost parity and scalability.
We are interested in AI-native e-invoicing and procurement platforms that go beyond digitizing documents to become the system of record for cross-border trade. The opportunity is particularly acute in verticals with complex tariffs, duties, and onboarding cycles (e.g., construction, electronics). Filters: ability to integrate AR/AP, automate compliance, and shorten onboarding timelines from months to weeks.
We are tracking AI-enabled financial routing layers that unify invoicing, payments (including stablecoins), and trade documentation into a single workflow. In an environment of shifting tariffs and multi-country sourcing, a platform that embeds tax, duties, and payment logic directly into AP could meaningfully compress working capital cycles. Filters: vertical depth, compliance readiness, and potential to replace legacy providers (Pagero, Melio) rather than sit beside them.
We are tracking AI-first genomic design platforms. COVID validated mRNA delivery; the unlock is now sequence optimization and proprietary synthetic data generation. Filters: full wet-lab loop (not just annotations), ability to build a defensible data moat, and technical founders with pharma traction.
We are interested in retrofit teleoperation kits for heavy equipment as a wedge into autonomy. The unlock is legality (not voiding OEM warranties) and building proprietary operator-action datasets. Filters: ability to pair teleop data with autonomy training, equipment finance overlays (sale-leaseback, rental streams), and safety ROI for contractors.
We are tracking digital metal service centers modernizing U.S. re-industrialization. Next-day cut metals with software-driven quoting and inventory are compelling, but margins hinge on mill relationships and two-sided marketplace liquidity. Filters: instant quoting adoption, supply contracts with mills, and SKU-level telemetry feeding predictive procurement.
We are not pursuing AI compliance marketing tools (e.g. regulated firm SEO/SEM). Crowded wedge, low defensibility, and not venture-scale.
We are cautious on AI identity firewalls for enterprise agents. Hundreds of teams will emerge; unclear why one would win over another without deep distribution advantages.
We remain interested in stablecoin infrastructure but are unlikely to pursue preempted mega-rounds (e.g. $30M seeds). Our edge lies in earlier entry or differentiated infra beyond treasury management.
We are tracking new AI-native billing and payments platforms. Stripe is mis-fit for usage-based LLM/agent credits, creating white space for a “payments protocol for AI.” Filters: ability to unify credits across models, early developer adoption, and wallet primitives extensible to agent-to-agent transactions.
We are tracking AI-enabled accounting automation. Firms like Entendre show demand for agentic month-end close and reporting, but barriers include regulation requiring human sign-off and crowded workflow tooling. Long-term opportunity may lie in tax-specialist augmentation rather than full AI accounting firms.
We are cautious on AI-native tax brain platforms at high valuations (e.g. $40M post). Strong product-market need, but heavily preempted by insiders and difficult for Montage to add edge at late seed.
We are not pursuing early healthcare workflow tools (e.g. Dakota Health). Vertical insurance/clinical sales remain slow and feature-like rather than platform-scale.
We are tracking AI-enabled fraud prevention for banks, but cautious on TAM. Long sales cycles and competitive overlap with Abnormal/Sublime suggest consolidation risk; embedded pilots (e.g. Scotiabank) are a positive but not yet material.
We are tracking AI time-series intelligence for supply chain forecasting. Structural pain in inventory and procurement is real, but monetization depends on moving beyond forecasting into decision execution. Filters: ability to embed within strategic sourcing, predictive accuracy across sparse signals, and conversion of insights into operational contracts.
We are interested in AI-native 3D content engines for gaming and media. Differentiation lies in combining AI scene generation with pro-grade creative control. Filters: adoption by indie developers/studios, quality of foundation model outputs, and expansion beyond games into film/virtual production.
We are not pursuing early AI-commerce personalization layers. Space is crowded, agency-like, and differentiation between on-site copilots and off-site optimization is weak.
We are not pursuing AI-native product design platforms for e-commerce (e.g. custom t-shirt generators). Highly commoditized and poor technical defensibility.
We are tracking GIS/geo-spatial AI challengers to Esri. Long-standing pain around data tagging and manipulation could open markets if embedding tech meaningfully reduces analyst burden. Filters: ability to expand market TAM (not just steal share), vertical wedges in construction/government, and credible technical depth.
We are not pursuing YC-priced infra plays (e.g. $30M for data-center orchestration). Vision (AI workload optimization + energy efficiency) is compelling, but valuation risk outweighs early traction.
We are not pursuing AI-enabled real-time medical interpretation. Strong need, but technical accuracy and liability bar is high, and incumbents with human interpreters already hold distribution.

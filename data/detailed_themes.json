  "market_opportunity": "The autoimmune therapeutics market is projected to exceed $180B by 2030, with over 100 diseases lacking effective targeted treatments. AI-native drug discovery platforms are compressing early-stage development timelines by up to 70%, from target discovery to IND readiness within 18–24 months. As single-cell and spatial omics datasets scale to tens of millions of patient-derived cells, and as generative models advance in protein and antibody design, precision immunology represents a once-in-a-decade opportunity to create category-defining biotech companies. The winners will combine proprietary immune datasets, generative model architectures, and CRO-orchestrated experimental feedback loops to unlock disease-modifying therapies across the autoimmune landscape."
